The main problem I investigated was how to classify an NBA player as an All-Star based on statistics and data from the previous 15+ years of player statistics. The second problem I chose was to predict a student's final grade in a class using various features (like income level, time spent playing outside, parents' occupation etc). You can find the results and my analysis in the link above.</p>

The application provides a platform for students in a distributed classroom to collaboratively generate a pool of review questions. The tool allows a student to test their comprehension of the material using this pool of questions sourced from classmates.</p>

It displays the amount of carbon emissions that could be saved if one were to choose public transportation for his/her daily commute (instead of driving a car). The app uses the Google Maps API for directions and various online sources for calculating the emissions.</p>
